# Data fetcher (proxies supported)
It supports **proxy rotation**, **Discord webhook alerts**, and a **safety mode** that ensures no requests are made without proxies. This makes it especially useful for environments where data fetching must be controlled, monitored, and/or logged in real-time.  

----------------

## üöÄ Features:
- **Safety mode** ‚Üí prevents running without proxies.
- **Proxy support** ‚Üí works with HTTP & HTTPS proxies.
- **Automatic saving** ‚Üí each response is saved as a file.
- **Discord webhook notifications** ‚Üí real-time alerts for:
  - Success (file saved)
  - Request errors
  - Timeouts
  - Proxy issues
- **Easily configurable waiting interval** ‚Üí default is every 3 hours.
- **Continuous loop** ‚Üí even on errors/fails it keeps running until stopped manually.
- **safety mode** ‚Üí Ensures no unproxied requests are sent when **safety mode** is enabled.
